Not entirely sure who the original creator was, but I picked it up from user wryandginger in the community Home Assistant post here https://community.home-assistant.io/t/esp32-a1s-audio-kit-media-player/522245 which I then modified and improved upon making it a complete solution.

ESP32-Audio-Kit is an ESP32 Module placed on an Audio Board with 8x Programmable Buttons. It provides an Microphone jack a Headphone jack (Aux) along with speaker headers for using small 8 ohm 3W speakers (mono or stereo). There are onboard microphones...but (see below). It uses a standard USB Micro port for power/programming. The board can also be battery powered with it's own built in charge controller (battery management) that it charges via the USB power.

I should add that the attached Microphones don't function correctly because of the resistor layout on the board (maybe I'll post a detailed picture explaining the problem). Therefore no implementation of the microphones is done on this board. In addition, aside from patching onboard or microphone jack through to the headphone jack (or plugged in speaker), I'm not sure what else it could be used for (the patch through idea though is interesting to add an additional 'controllable' audio source maybe) since getting an audio stream through the ESP32 and into Home Assistant is (at the moment) beyond me.
